        <h4>About the creator:</h4>
        <p>I have been experimenting with web development on my own for a little over a year. I prefer full-stack development in ASP.net MVC with C# and razor. Currently, I am working on becoming more familiar bootstrap and databases. I would also like to become better at optimizing for both mobile and desktop. As of now, I am looking for a job, so please let me know if you are interested (contact at bottom).</p>
        <p>I have been an avid weightlifter quite some time - I have consistently lifted 5-6 days a week for almost 6 years. I prefer powerlifting &amp; strongman lifts over typical bodybuilding. When I began lifting during my senior year of high school, I was 6'2" 170lbs. Since then, much has changed:
        <ul>
            <li>Height: 6'2"</li>
            <li>Current Bodyweight: 245lbs</li>
            <li>Favorite Lift: Shrugs</li>
            <li>Current Maxes:<ul>
                <li>Benchpress: 365lbs</li>
                <li>Squat: 445lbs</li>
                <li>Deadlift: 605lbs</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Since January of 2014, I have been keeping a journal of my exercises and progress in the gym. I decided to create this site to mimic that journal as well as be able to do things like create statistics about the data recorded (see the @Html.ActionLink("About", "About") section for future site capabilities). I also wanted somewhere that I could practice and learn more about web development. This is a work in progress.
