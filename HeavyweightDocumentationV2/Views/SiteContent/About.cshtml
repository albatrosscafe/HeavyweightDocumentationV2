    <div id="overviewContent">
        <p>"Heavyweight Documentation" is a site that allows users to manage their weightlifting progress over a period of time.</p>
        <p>
            The goal of the project is to provide a personal area on the web in which a user can track and view the statistics of their weightlifting career.
            It sacrifices some of the fancier features that similar websites might have in an effort to keep the site as user-friendly and efficient as possible.
        </p>
        <p>That being said, this site caters more to the weightlifting aspect of physical fitness than to fitness in general. It will not have a sections that watches your meals and calories. It is purely intended to be an enhanced online workout journal.
        <p>
            The main selling point of this project is that nearly everything is customizable.
            Whereas similar programs force you to adhere to their design by making you select workouts and exercises from their predefined lists, this project allows you to create and modify everything to your own standards.
